1. Start with a basic, functional version of the feature (MVP).
2. Gather feedback (from logs, tests, or visual inspection).
3. Identify one specific area for improvement or refinement.
4. Apply the refinement (Refactor, Optimize, or Enhance).
5. Verify the change with tests and visual checks.
6. Repeat the process recursively until the feature meets all requirements.
