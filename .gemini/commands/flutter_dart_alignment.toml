1. Follow 'Effective Dart' guidelines for clean and idiomatic Dart code.
2. Apply 'SOLID Principles' to ensure maintainability, scalability, and testability.
3. Use 'Riverpod' for state management, leveraging 'AsyncNotifier' and 'Notifier' with code generation.
4. Maintain high 'Code Quality' through linting, formatting, and static analysis.
5. Use proper error handling and logging (using the `logger` package) to ensure system reliability and observability.
6. For dependencies, use constructor injection with '@injectable' where appropriate, or Riverpod providers.
